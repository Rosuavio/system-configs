# System configs

Personal system configs and supporting infra.

## Why?

Just having a repo with bunch of NixOS modules is not easy enough to reliably
share across machines, run and deploy updates and maintain the same guaranties
nixos typically provides.

## Usage

To use the modules import `./module/`

> NOTE: You can use this repo as a derivation using npins, nix-thunk and the like.
